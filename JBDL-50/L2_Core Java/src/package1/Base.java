   * Abstraction - achieved by abstract classes and interfaces
   * Encapsulation - properties of a real world entity --> member variable,
                     behaviours of a real world entity --> member functions
   * Polymorphism - Different ways to execute things
     Compile time -- Overloading of functions
                     Defining functions with the same name but diff signature (number and type of arguments)
     Runtime --      Overriding of functions
                     Defining functions with the same name and signature in the parent and child classes

   * Inheritance -- Capability of a class to inherit properties and behaviours from it's parent
